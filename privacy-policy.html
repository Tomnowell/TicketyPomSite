            <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p>TicketyPom is developed by Tom Nowell. This privacy policy explains 
                how the app handles your information.</p>

            <h3>1. Information TicketyPom Collects</h3>
            <p>TicketyPom does not collect, store, process, 
                or transmit any personal data to the developer. 
                The app has no analytics, no tracking, 
                and no external servers.</p>

            <h3>2. Access to Device Data</h3>
            <p>TicketyPom may request access to certain data or system features 
                on your device (such as Reminders) in order to function.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>stays on your device, and</li>
                <li>is never sent to the developer.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Users can revoke these permissions at any time in 
                Settings → Privacy & Security.</p>

            <h3>3. Integration With External Services</h3>
            <p>TicketyPom may integrate with external services to provide optional 
                functionality.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Currently, the only integrated service is Apple Reminders, 
                    which is handled entirely by iOS.</li>
                <li>Reminder data accessed by TicketyPom does not leave your device.</li>
                <li>Apple may collect or process information as described in 
                    their own privacy policy. TicketyPom has no control over 
                    Apple's data practices.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If TicketyPom adds support for additional services in the future, 
                this policy will be updated accordingly.</p>

            <h3>4. Local App Data</h3>
            <p>All app-generated data—such as timer settings, preferences, 
                or task metadata—remains stored locally on your device only.</p>

            <h3>5. Third-Party Analytics or Advertising</h3>
            <p>TicketyPom does not use third-party 
                analytics tools or advertising SDKs.</p>

            <h3>6. Children's Privacy</h3>
            <p>TicketyPom does not collect any personal data from users of any age.</p>

            <h3>7. Changes to This Policy</h3>
            <p>This policy may be updated when new features or integrations are added. 
                The latest version will always be available at this URL.</p>

            <h3>8. Contact</h3>
